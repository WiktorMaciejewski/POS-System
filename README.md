# POS-System
Project to polish and improve c#, winforms and sql knowledge

This application is still in development. It is an exercise to polish and improve my knowledge of c#, winforms and sql. 
The goal is to create a Point Of Sales system which has the capabilities to generate barcodes, let the user set up a database of products,
use the database to fetch products by their barcode number, generate reciepts and generate various sales (and other) reports. Further goals
may be added in the future.
