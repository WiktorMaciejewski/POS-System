# POS-System
Project to polish and improve c#, winforms and sql knowledge

Note: the barcode generator requires the user to copy the "Code 128 Regular" & "EAN-13" font files into "C:\Windows\Fonts" folder. Otherwise, the generator will not work as desired.

This application is still in development. It is an exercise to polish and improve my knowledge of c#, winforms and sql. 
The goal is to create a Point Of Sales system which has the capabilities to generate barcodes, let the user set up a database of products,
use the database to fetch products by their barcode number, generate reciepts and generate various sales (and other) reports. 
Further goals may be added in the future.

At this time the "Generate Barcode" tab is the one that works as desired, the rest are still in development.
